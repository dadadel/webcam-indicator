webcam-indicator
================

This is a Python script appindicator for Unity providing your webcam status.

I have a computer with a webcam and a special keyboard touch allowing to
activate it and deactivate it but unfortunately no LED to know the status.
So I wrote this appindicator to know under Unity the status of the webcam.

It is very basic as it will only check existance of the device file, but it
remains helpfull.

To use it, you can put it for instance in **/opt/webcamindicator**.
Update in the script the icons path.
Then you can launch *Startup Applications* and add that script.

After login you will see the appindicator icon on or off depending on the
webcam status.

I provide two ugly on/off icons that I drew really quickly. Feel free to use
them or use other prettier pictures.
